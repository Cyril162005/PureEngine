# PureEngine — Build Continuation (v3)

## Context
PureEngine Step 25 through Step 34 are complete and verified. This continuation begins from the hardened state established after the v2 tracker was superseded: data-driven hostile config, alternate scene reuse, periodic frame-time visibility, and the automated hostile parser test target.

The current project remains intentionally minimal. The source and build output remain the authority, and this tracker is only a forward pointer for future work.

## Goal
Continue from the verified engine hardening work without inventing new abstractions, managers, or registries before a concrete need is demonstrated.

## Rule
No step starts until there is a real demonstrated need in the source, the build, or a required conversation-driven follow-up. The tracker stays intentionally empty until a new, concrete, scoped requirement appears.

## Steps

No steps are defined yet. This file exists as the forward continuation marker for future work only.

## Candidate Roadmap
The items below are non-binding, exploratory ideas only. They are not a step queue and do not define the next concrete requirement. The goal is to make PureEngine feel like a playable 2026 arcade survival game while staying flat/2D and avoiding 3D or engine-framework scope.

- Hit/damage feedback (flash, knockback, or similar juice on catch)
- Sound effects tied to real events (catch, game over, high score) — check the existing audio boundary before proposing any new API
- Visually distinct hostile types (not just speed variance) — check the existing renderer texture-by-index convention before proposing new work
- A win condition or objective beyond pure survival time
- Menu/UI polish (instructions, controls hint)
- Packaging for distribution (itch.io-ready build)

This list is intentionally not the step queue. Steps still get pulled one at a time from real code inspection, and `kill_criteria` still applies to any future work.

## Reference: 2D/3D Architecture Notes (non-binding)

This section is informational only. It is not a roadmap, not a step queue, and not a proposal to pre-plan future work. Its purpose is to document the architectural distinction between a flat 2D game and a true 3D engine so a future real need can be evaluated against earlier analysis instead of speculation.

PureEngine's committed direction is flat 2D. The project is intentionally built around a single world plane, shared transform assumptions, and a renderer that treats the scene as a 2D playfield rather than a full 3D world. A flat-to-2D extension is a natural evolution of the current architecture if a concrete need appears, such as:

- overlapping entities rendering wrong because depth ordering is implicit rather than explicit
- a camera/view split becoming necessary for a larger world or staged presentation
- transform/render decoupling becoming useful for world-space vs screen-space logic
- explicit depth or layer fields being needed for draw ordering and collision grouping
- broad-phase collision becoming a measurable bottleneck at substantially higher entity counts

Those are all changes that keep the project in the same design family: still a 2D game, just with clearer separation of concerns and more scalable world logic. They do not require replacing the engine's current model; they are natural extensions of it.

A 2D-to-3D transition is not an extension. It is a different project. It requires a new transform system, a different rendering pipeline, and a different physics model. A 3D project needs world matrices and camera projection for real depth, a different scene graph or spatial structure, different material and lighting assumptions, and a substantially different collision model. That is not a minor version bump of a flat arcade engine; it is a different technical foundation.

This section exists so that any future genuine need can be assessed honestly against the actual project direction and history: flat 2D remains the intended scope, and any 3D discussion should be treated as a separate endeavor rather than a default evolution of this codebase.

## Known Follow-ups

- Event audio (GAMEOVER.wav / win_sound.wav) continues playing after returning to MENU — `stopEventSounds()` attempt with `ma_sound_stop()` did not resolve it, needs deeper investigation (possibly miniaudio API misuse, or the sound object isn't the one actually playing). Not blocking, deferred.

## Kill criteria
If any step's scope keeps expanding instead of shrinking, stop, cut scope, and re-record a smaller definition_of_done before continuing. Do not introduce an abstraction, manager, registry, or subsystem unless the current implementation demonstrates a concrete need for it.
